# NANO - Minipops

Arduino project based in Minipops design by Jan Ostman (DSP Synthesizers) 

The hardware consists in an Arduino Uno including it shield with 9 slide switches, 2 rotary potentiometers and 1 LED. 
Software in the CODE folder contains all the necessary to convert your Arduino Uno in a Minipops drum box.
